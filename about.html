					<h3>Mission</h3>
					<p>FEMMES (Females Excelling More in Math, Engineering, and Science) at the University of Chicago seeks to engage middle school girls in hands-on activities in the field of computer science in an effort to close the gender gap in technology. While women make up the majority of bachelor's degrees in the United States, only 12% of computer science degrees are earned by women. By 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor predicts that there will be 1.4 million job openings for computer specialists but that there will only be enough graduates to fill 29% of these openings. We hope that by providing middle school girls with the opportunity to explore their interests in technology and by giving them real world technological skills to build upon, they will be inspired to continue their studies in computer science and help end gender disparity in this growing field.</p>
